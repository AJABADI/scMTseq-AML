#  Single-Cell Methylation and Transcriptome Analysis of AML cells using sparse PLS

A pilot study. For further details read [our poster](https://f1000research.com/posters/8-1134).



### To-Do

------------------------

  * Looking at '## lci', there might be a problem with definition of lci >> reconsider weights
  * sPLS and DIABLO vs latest on MO integration and summarise weakness/strengths/methods
  * A solid reproducible GO enrichment for signatures
  * Re-check your mouse gene IDs with the right ensemble
